This is a web app that promps the user to login with an account that is already existing in our database. Once the user is authenticated, they will be taken to the dashboard where there will be a summary of the users account. 

### This summary includes:

* Interest rate
* Ability to sort transactions for greatest to least

### Other functionalities on dashboard:
* Timer that logs the user out in 5 minutes if there is no activity.
* Ability to transfer in between other Bankist accounts.
* Ability to request a loan.
* Ability to log out using same credentials used to log in.
